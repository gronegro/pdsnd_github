### Project Title
Bikeshare Project

### Description

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

This is a python project to analyze bikeshare data in three cities, Chicago, New York City and Washington. The project let you interact with data to find statistics related to use of bikesharing, the trips, time travelled, type of users.

### Files used
The files used for this project are csv files with data from new yor city, chicago and washington bikeshare program information. The data is randomly selected for the first six months of 2017. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have Gender, Birth Year columns
